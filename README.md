# BrickBreaker

About the Game:
We will implement a simple brick breaker game. We have layers of bricks and ball with which to break the layers of the block. The player moves the paddle from left to right to keep the ball from falling. A life is reduced when the player fails to hit the ball. The game goes on until all the block has been broken.
The paddle doesn’t bounce the ball like a mirror, although it does so when the ball hits right in the middle. The closer the bounce take place to the left end of the paddle; a more significant left turn is added to an expected mirror bouncing.
A regular brick disappears when it’s hit by the ball, or breaks a little if it’s a bulkier brick. At the same time, there will be music outputs to match different game effects. The basic user interface may be similar to Figure 1. If time permits, we plan to add more features to the game, such as bricks that drop items to make the paddle longer, make the ball faster, or turn the ball on fire so that it burns every brick on the path.
 We will build a scoring system that reflects how efficient the user is to clear the bricks. Number of total paddle hits and maximum brick hits per trip are two of the possible factors.
